# DSW-email-test
SendGrid version:
Emails to my personal email arrived.  Emails to my work email did not, even though SendGrid Activity shows that they were delivered.
.env file is in local repo.

Flask-Mail without SendGrid version:
Error when sending email, probably because I haven't set my email to allow less secure apps.
